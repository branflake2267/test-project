##Configuring the Eclipse Workspace
This file contains instructions on how to setup the Eclipse environment to
work with the source code for the Google Plugin for Eclipse.

Configuring the Eclipse workspace to develop on the Google Eclipse plugin is very
much like getting set up to develop for GWT. The same style rules apply, and
Eclipse projects are provided for import. The "settings" directory
mentioned below is under "eclipse", in your checkout of plugin.

* *Macintosh users*: Note that on the Macintosh version of Eclipse, "Preferences"
is under the "Eclipse" menu, not under "Window".

##Dependent Plugins

* Restart Eclipse to detect the new plugins.

###Eclipse 3.3, 3.4:

* Copy the plugin JARs from `tools/swtbot/3.3` into your Eclipse's `/dropins` directory (on 3.4)
or `/plugins` directory (on 3.3).  

###Eclipse 3.5+:

* Copy the plugin JARs from `tools/swtbot/3.5` into your Eclipse's `/dropins` directory.
* The `com.google.gdt.eclipse.maven` plugin requires M2Eclipse (Maven support) to be installed.
* The `com.google.gdt.eclipse.gph.hge` project requires MercurialEclipse to be installed. You can either
close the project, or install MercurialEclipse: http://cbes.javaforge.com/update.
* The `com.google.gdt.eclipse.gph.subclipse` project requires Subclipse to be installed. You can either
close the project, or install Subclipse: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x.
* The `com.google.gdt.eclipse.gph.subversive` project requires Subversive to be installed. You can either
close the project, or install Subversive: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios (under Collaboration).

##Importing the Google Plugin projects

Having set up your workspace appropriately, you can now import the appropriate
projects.

File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

Select your checkout of the trunk of Google Eclipse Plugin to see all of the
Eclipse projects for you to import. You should only import the projects that
correspond to the version of Eclipse that you are using for development, and
the platform you are running on. For example, if you have Eclipse 3.4, do not
import a project that has "3.3" in its name. As another example, if you are
running on Windows, do not import projects that have readme "win32" or "macosx"
in their name. 

##Launching the Plugin

Once your projects have been imported, go to the Package Explorer and
right-click on the "com.google.gdt.eclipse.suite" project. Go to 
"Run As" > "Eclipse Application".  Another instance of Eclipse should launch,
running GPE!

Note: Setting these two environment variables will cause the GWT and App Engine
SDKs to be registered as GPE SDK Bundles. However, in development mode, this
only happens when the workbench metadata is first created. To have the workbench
pick up changes to these variables,  go to the Main tab in your launch
configuration, and check 'Clear' under Workspace Data. Note that this will also
remove any projects that you created in the runtime workbench.
